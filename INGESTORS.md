# Ingestors: Real-Time Data Collection for MCP Secure Proxy

> **Status:** Phase 2b (Stripe Webhook Ingestor + Generic Webhook Base Class) — **Complete**
> **Date:** 2026-02-18

---

## Overview

Ingestors add **real-time data pull** capability to mcp-secure-proxy. Previously the system was purely request/response — Claude could push HTTP requests out to APIs but could not receive asynchronous incoming data. Services like Discord, Slack, and GitHub offer real-time streams (WebSocket gateways, webhooks, event APIs) that can proactively feed data into the system.

Ingestors are **long-lived data collectors** running on the remote server that buffer incoming events in per-caller ring buffers. Claude polls for new events through the existing encrypted MCP channel using `poll_events` and `ingestor_status` tools.

### Design Principles

- **Zero secrets on the client** — ingestors run server-side; tokens never leave the remote process
- **Per-caller isolation** — each caller gets its own ingestor instances with their own buffers and connection state
- **No new dependencies** — uses native WebSocket (Node 22+) and existing infrastructure
- **Backward compatible** — existing tool handlers and test patterns are preserved
- **Connection-centric** — ingestor config lives in connection templates alongside route definitions

### Data Flow

1. **Startup**: Remote server creates an `IngestorManager`, which iterates all callers and their connections. For each connection with an `ingestor` config block, it creates the appropriate ingestor instance.
2. **Ingestion**: The ingestor connects to the external service (e.g., Discord Gateway WebSocket), authenticates using resolved secrets, and streams events into a per-caller ring buffer.
3. **Polling**: Claude calls `poll_events` (through the MCP proxy → encrypted channel → remote server). The remote server retrieves events from the ring buffer since the caller's last cursor and returns them.
4. **Status**: Claude calls `ingestor_status` to check connection health, buffer sizes, and error states.

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Ingestors are per-server, not per-session | Multiple Claude sessions from the same caller share the same ingestor/buffer, avoiding duplicate connections |
| Ring buffer (not unbounded queue) | Bounded memory usage; oldest events evict naturally. Default 200, max 1000 |
| Cursor-based polling (`after_id`) | Stateless on the client side; Claude just tracks the last event ID it saw |
| Config in connection templates | Keeps ingestor config co-located with the connection it belongs to |
| Native WebSocket (Node 22+) | Zero npm dependency additions |
| `ToolContext` third parameter | Backward-compatible — existing handlers ignore the extra arg |

## Component Details

### Ring Buffer (`ring-buffer.ts`)

A generic `RingBuffer<T>` with fixed capacity. When full, the oldest item is silently evicted. Uses a circular array with head pointer and count for O(1) push.

- **`push(item)`** — Write at head, advance, evict if full
- **`toArray()`** — Returns all items in chronological order (oldest first)
- **`since(afterId)`** — Cursor-based retrieval: returns items where `item.id > afterId`
- **`size`** — Current item count
- **`clear()`** — Resets buffer without changing capacity

### Base Ingestor (`base-ingestor.ts`)

Abstract class that all ingestor types extend. Provides:

- **State machine**: `stopped` → `starting` → `connected` (↔ `reconnecting`) → `stopped` | `error`
- **Ring buffer**: Per-instance `RingBuffer<IngestedEvent>` (default capacity 200)
- **Event counting**: `totalEventsReceived` counter (monotonic, survives buffer evictions)
- **`pushEvent(eventType, data)`**: Creates an `IngestedEvent` with auto-incrementing ID and ISO timestamp, pushes to buffer, emits `'event'`
- **`getEvents(afterId)`**: Retrieves buffered events since cursor
- **`getStatus()`**: Returns `IngestorStatus` snapshot

### Ingestor Manager (`manager.ts`)

Singleton per remote server. Keyed by `callerAlias:connectionAlias`.

- **`startAll()`**: Called once at server startup. Iterates `config.callers`, resolves routes and secrets, creates ingestor instances for connections with `ingestor` config
- **`stopAll()`**: Graceful shutdown of all ingestors (called during server shutdown)
- **`getEvents(callerAlias, connectionAlias, afterId)`**: Events for a specific connection
- **`getAllEvents(callerAlias, afterId)`**: Events across all ingestors for a caller, sorted chronologically
- **`getStatuses(callerAlias)`**: Status of all ingestors for a caller
- **Factory**: `createIngestor()` dispatches to `DiscordGatewayIngestor` based on `config.type` and `config.websocket.protocol`

### Discord Gateway Ingestor (`discord-gateway.ts`)

Full implementation of the [Discord Gateway v10](https://discord.com/developers/docs/events/gateway) protocol:

**Lifecycle:**
1. `connect(url)` — Opens native WebSocket to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=10&encoding=json`
2. Server sends `HELLO` with heartbeat interval
3. Client starts heartbeat with jitter, sends `IDENTIFY` (or `RESUME` if reconnecting)
4. Server sends `READY` with session ID and resume URL
5. Dispatch events flow in continuously

**Features:**
- **Heartbeat**: Initial jitter delay, then fixed interval. Tracks ACKs; zombie detection triggers reconnect
- **Resume**: Stores `session_id`, `sequence`, and `resume_gateway_url` from `READY`. On reconnect, sends `RESUME` instead of `IDENTIFY` to replay missed events
- **Reconnect**: Exponential backoff (1s → 30s max), up to 10 attempts
- **Close code handling**: Non-recoverable codes (4004, 4010-4014) → permanent error. Session-invalidating codes (4007, 4009) → clear session, re-identify
- **Invalid Session**: Resumable → wait 1-5s then resume. Not resumable → clear session, re-identify
- **Event filtering**: `eventFilter` array in config; empty = capture all
- **Payload filtering**: `guildIds`, `channelIds`, `userIds` arrays in config; events without the filtered field pass through (preserves lifecycle events)
- **Intents**: Configurable via config, default `4609` = `GUILDS | GUILD_MESSAGES | DIRECT_MESSAGES`. The `discord-bot.json` template uses `3276799` (all intents including privileged)

**Exported:**
- `DiscordGatewayIngestor` class
- `DiscordIntents` const (all intent flags for easy composition)
- `ALL_INTENTS` const (all intents OR'd together, including privileged: `3276799`)
- `ALL_NON_PRIVILEGED_INTENTS` const (all non-privileged intents OR'd together)

### MCP Tool Registrations

**`poll_events`** (in `src/mcp/server.ts`):
```
Parameters:
  connection? (string) — filter by connection alias, omit for all
  after_id? (number)   — cursor; returns events with id > after_id
```
Delegates through `sendEncryptedRequest('poll_events', ...)` to the remote server's `poll_events` handler.

**`ingestor_status`** (in `src/mcp/server.ts`):
```
Parameters: none
```
Returns status of all ingestors for the calling user. Includes connection state, buffer sizes, event counts, errors.

### Connection Template (`discord-bot.json`)

Added `ingestor` block:
```json
{
  "ingestor": {
    "type": "websocket",
    "websocket": {
      "gatewayUrl": "wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=10&encoding=json",
      "protocol": "discord",
      "intents": 3276799
    }
  }
}
```

The intents value `3276799` includes all Discord Gateway intents, including the three privileged intents (`GUILD_MEMBERS`, `GUILD_PRESENCES`, `MESSAGE_CONTENT`). This requires enabling all three privileged intents in the Discord Developer Portal. For a non-privileged-only configuration, use `3243775`. The code default (when `intents` is omitted) remains `4609` = `GUILDS | GUILD_MESSAGES | DIRECT_MESSAGES`.

---

## Test Coverage

### Ring Buffer (`ring-buffer.test.ts`) — 11 tests
- Push and retrieve in correct order
- Evicts oldest items when over capacity
- Wraps correctly with interleaved push/read
- Returns empty array when empty
- Works with capacity of 1
- `since()` returns events after cursor
- `since(-1)` returns all events
- `since()` past all items returns empty
- `clear()` removes all items
- Handles exact capacity fill
- `since()` handles non-numeric IDs gracefully

### Manager (`manager.test.ts`) — 4 tests
- Returns empty events for caller with no ingestors
- Returns empty for unknown caller
- Handles connections without ingestor config
- Start/stop lifecycle

### E2E (`server.e2e.test.ts`) — 4 tests
- `poll_events` returns empty array when no ingestors configured
- `poll_events` with connection filter returns empty array
- `poll_events` with `after_id` cursor returns empty array
- `ingestor_status` returns empty array when no ingestors configured

### Build Verification
- `npm run build` — TypeScript compiles cleanly
- `npm test` — 139 tests pass (2 pre-existing suite failures unrelated to ingestors)
- `npm run lint` — No lint errors

---

## Future Work

### Phase 2: Webhook Ingestor — **Complete**

Added support for receiving HTTP webhooks. GitHub is the first webhook provider, with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. The webhook listener shares the same Express app/port as the remote server.

**Architecture:** Unlike WebSocket ingestors (which maintain outbound connections), webhook ingestors are passive receivers. The Express app receives `POST /webhooks/:path`, looks up matching ingestor instances via `IngestorManager.getWebhookIngestors(path)`, and fans out the payload to all matching instances (one per caller). Each ingestor independently verifies the signature and buffers the event.

**New Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/github-types.ts` | GitHub-specific types, HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`verifyGitHubSignature`), header extraction (`extractGitHubHeaders`) |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/github-webhook-ingestor.ts` | `GitHubWebhookIngestor` class extending `WebhookIngestor`. Passive lifecycle (`start()` → immediately `'connected'`). Implements `verifySignature()`, `extractEventType()`, `extractEventData()`. Self-registers as `'webhook:generic'` factory. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/index.ts` | Barrel exports |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/github-webhook-ingestor.test.ts` | 25 unit tests covering signature verification, header extraction, lifecycle, event buffering, factory registration |

**Modified Files:**

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `src/remote/server.ts` | Added `express.raw()` body parser for `/webhooks` path. Added `POST /webhooks/:path` route with fan-out dispatch to matching ingestors. Returns 200 if any ingestor accepts, 403 if all reject, 404 if no ingestors match. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/manager.ts` | Added `import './webhook/github-webhook-ingestor.js'` for self-registration. Added `getWebhookIngestors(path)` method to find matching webhook ingestors across all callers. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/index.ts` | Added webhook barrel exports |
| `src/connections/github.json` | Added `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to secrets. Added `ingestor` block with `type: "webhook"` and GitHub signature verification config. |
| `src/remote/server.e2e.test.ts` | Added 6 e2e tests: valid webhook → poll_events, invalid signature → 403, missing signature → 403, unregistered path → 404, ingestor_status reporting, cursor-based polling |

**Signature Verification:**
- Optional: if `signatureHeader` and `signatureSecret` are both configured, incoming webhooks are verified; if either is absent, verification is skipped entirely
- GitHub uses `X-Hub-Signature-256` header with `sha256=<hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256>`
- Timing-safe comparison via `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks
- If the secret name is configured but the resolved value is missing, the webhook is rejected (config error)

**Config example (GitHub):**
```json
{
  "ingestor": {
    "type": "webhook",
    "webhook": {
      "path": "github",
      "signatureHeader": "X-Hub-Signature-256",
      "signatureSecret": "GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
    }
  }
}
```

**Setup requirements:**
- Set `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var on the remote server (matching the secret configured in GitHub's webhook settings)
- The remote server needs to be publicly accessible for webhooks (or behind a tunnel like ngrok/Cloudflare Tunnel)
- Point the GitHub webhook URL to `https://<server>/webhooks/github`

**Future webhook providers:** Linear and Trello can be added by creating thin subclasses of the generic `WebhookIngestor` base class (see Phase 2b below).

### Phase 2b: Stripe Webhook Ingestor + Generic Webhook Base Class — **Complete**

Refactored the webhook ingestor into a generic `WebhookIngestor` base class with pluggable signature verification and event extraction. GitHub and Stripe are now thin subclasses. This sets the pattern for future webhook providers (Linear, Trello, etc.).

**Architecture:** The `WebhookIngestor` abstract base class extends `BaseIngestor` and provides the common webhook handling pipeline (`handleWebhook()` → verify → parse → extract → filter → buffer). Subclasses override three abstract methods:
- `verifySignature(headers, rawBody)` — service-specific signature verification
- `extractEventType(headers, body)` — how to determine the event type
- `extractEventData(headers, body)` — what data shape to store in the ring buffer

The factory registry now uses `webhook:<protocol>` keys (mirroring `websocket:<protocol>`), where the default is `webhook:generic` (GitHub) and Stripe registers as `webhook:stripe`.

**New Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/base-webhook-ingestor.ts` | `WebhookIngestor` abstract base class. Owns `webhookPath`, `eventFilter`, passive `start()`/`stop()`, and concrete `handleWebhook()` pipeline. Defines abstract `verifySignature()`, `extractEventType()`, `extractEventData()`. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/stripe-types.ts` | Stripe-specific types, signature verification (`verifyStripeSignature`), header parsing (`parseStripeSignatureHeader`), `STRIPE_SIGNATURE_HEADER` constant, `DEFAULT_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE` (300s) |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/stripe-webhook-ingestor.ts` | `StripeWebhookIngestor` class extending `WebhookIngestor`. Implements Stripe `Stripe-Signature` verification with timestamp tolerance and replay protection. Extracts event type from JSON body `type` field. Self-registers as `'webhook:stripe'` factory. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/stripe-webhook-ingestor.test.ts` | 39 unit tests covering signature parsing, verification (valid, invalid, expired, malformed), lifecycle, event extraction, factory registration |

**Modified Files:**

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/github-webhook-ingestor.ts` | Refactored `GitHubWebhookIngestor` to extend `WebhookIngestor` instead of `BaseIngestor`. Renamed from `webhook-ingestor.ts` for symmetry with `stripe-webhook-ingestor.ts`. Signature verification, event type extraction, and data shaping now implemented as overrides. Factory key changed from `'webhook'` to `'webhook:generic'`. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/types.ts` | Added optional `protocol?: string` field to `WebhookIngestorConfig` |
| `src/remote/ingestors/registry.ts` | Updated `createIngestor()` key logic to use `webhook:<protocol>` keys (matching the `websocket:<protocol>` convention) |
| `src/remote/ingestors/manager.ts` | `getWebhookIngestors()` now checks `instanceof WebhookIngestor` (base class) instead of `GitHubWebhookIngestor`. Added Stripe factory self-registration import. |
| `src/remote/ingestors/webhook/index.ts` | Added `WebhookIngestor`, `StripeWebhookIngestor`, and Stripe utility exports |
| `src/remote/ingestors/index.ts` | Added `WebhookIngestor`, `StripeWebhookIngestor`, and Stripe-related exports |
| `src/connections/stripe.json` | Added `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to secrets. Added `ingestor` block with `type: "webhook"`, `protocol: "stripe"`, and Stripe signature verification config. |

**Stripe Signature Verification:**
- Stripe uses the `Stripe-Signature` header with format: `t=<unix_timestamp>,v1=<hex_sig>,v1=<hex_sig>,...`
- HMAC-SHA256 is computed over `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` (not the raw body alone)
- Timing-safe comparison against each `v1` signature (accept if ANY match)
- **Replay protection:** Rejects events older than a configurable tolerance (default 300 seconds / 5 minutes). Set tolerance to 0 to disable.
- If the secret name is configured but the resolved value is missing, the webhook is rejected (config error)

**Config example (Stripe):**
```json
{
  "ingestor": {
    "type": "webhook",
    "webhook": {
      "path": "stripe",
      "protocol": "stripe",
      "signatureHeader": "Stripe-Signature",
      "signatureSecret": "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
    }
  }
}
```

**Setup requirements:**
- Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var on the remote server (the `whsec_...` signing secret from the Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks)
- Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` env var for API access
- The remote server needs to be publicly accessible for webhooks (or behind a tunnel like ngrok/Cloudflare Tunnel)
- Point the Stripe webhook URL to `https://<server>/webhooks/stripe`

**Factory Key Convention (Updated):**
```
websocket:<protocol>  → websocket:discord, websocket:slack
webhook:<protocol>    → webhook:generic (GitHub, no protocol), webhook:stripe
poll                  → poll (no protocol needed yet)
```

### Phase 3: Polling Ingestor

Generic interval-based HTTP polling for APIs without real-time support (e.g., Notion, Jira, RSS feeds).

**Implementation:**
- Create `src/remote/ingestors/poll-ingestor.ts`
- Configurable interval, HTTP method, request body, and deduplication field
- Uses the existing `fetch` infrastructure with resolved secrets/headers from the connection
- Deduplication: track seen IDs to avoid pushing duplicate events

**Config example (Notion):**
```json
{
  "ingestor": {
    "type": "poll",
    "poll": {
      "url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/search",
      "intervalMs": 60000,
      "method": "POST",
      "body": { "sort": { "direction": "descending", "timestamp": "last_edited_time" } },
      "deduplicateBy": "id"
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Slack Socket Mode

Second WebSocket protocol implementation for Slack real-time events.

**Implementation:**
- Add `protocol: 'slack'` to `WebSocketIngestorConfig`
- Create `src/remote/ingestors/slack-socket.ts`
- Slack Socket Mode uses a different handshake: POST to `apps.connections.open` to get a WSS URL, then connect
- Events require acknowledgment (`acknowledge` envelope)
- Map Slack event types to `IngestedEvent`

### Phase 5: Caller-Level Ingestor Overrides — **Complete**

Callers can customize ingestor behavior without modifying connection templates via `ingestorOverrides` in `CallerConfig`.

**Supported override fields (all optional):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `intents` | `number` | Override the Discord Gateway intents bitmask |
| `eventFilter` | `string[]` | Override event type filter (e.g., `["MESSAGE_CREATE"]`) |
| `guildIds` | `string[]` | Only buffer events from these guild IDs |
| `channelIds` | `string[]` | Only buffer events from these channel IDs |
| `userIds` | `string[]` | Only buffer events from these user IDs |
| `bufferSize` | `number` | Override ring buffer capacity |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Disable the ingestor for this connection entirely |

**Config example (`remote.config.json`):**
```json
{
  "callers": {
    "my-laptop": {
      "peerKeyDir": "...",
      "connections": ["discord-bot"],
      "ingestorOverrides": {
        "discord-bot": {
          "guildIds": ["1470211573057458318"],
          "channelIds": ["1470211573749383210"],
          "eventFilter": ["MESSAGE_CREATE", "MESSAGE_UPDATE"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- `IngestorManager.startAll()` merges overrides with the connection template config via `mergeIngestorConfig()`
- Override fields replace template values; omitted fields inherit template defaults
- `disabled: true` skips ingestor creation entirely
- Payload-level filters (`guildIds`, `channelIds`, `userIds`) inspect event payloads; events without the filtered field pass through (preserving lifecycle events like `READY`, `RESUMED`)
- Filters are AND logic: if both `guildIds` and `channelIds` are set, an event must match both

### Phase 6: Token Deduplication / Shared Connections

When multiple callers use the same bot token (same `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`), they currently each get their own Gateway connection. Discord rate-limits `IDENTIFY` (max 1 per 5 seconds per token), so this doesn't scale.

**Implementation:**
- Detect when multiple callers resolve to the same token for the same connection template
- Share a single Gateway connection, fan out events to per-caller ring buffers
- Reference counting for start/stop lifecycle
- Per-caller event filters still apply independently

### Phase 7: Event Payload Optimization

Large Discord events (e.g., `GUILD_CREATE` with thousands of members) can consume significant memory in the ring buffer.

**Implementation:**
- Configurable field stripping: remove unnecessary nested objects before buffering
- Payload size limits with truncation
- Optional compression for large payloads
- Summary mode: store event metadata only, fetch full payload on demand via API

### Phase 8: Persistent Cursors

Currently, if Claude's session restarts, it loses its `after_id` cursor and may re-process events still in the buffer.

**Implementation:**
- Store last-seen cursor per caller in a lightweight persistence layer (file or SQLite)
- New tool parameter: `resume: true` to automatically start from the last acknowledged cursor
- Acknowledgment: `ack_events` tool to explicitly mark events as processed

### Other Ideas

- **Event transformation pipelines**: Pre-process events before buffering (e.g., extract message content, resolve user IDs)
- **Event routing**: Route specific event types to specific tools automatically (e.g., `MESSAGE_CREATE` → auto-invoke a handler)
- **Metrics/observability**: Prometheus-style metrics for event rates, buffer utilization, connection uptime
- **Health check endpoint**: HTTP endpoint for monitoring ingestor health externally
- **Configurable reconnect strategies**: Per-ingestor max retries, backoff curves, circuit breaker patterns

## Configuration Reference

### Connection Template Ingestor Block

```json
{
  "name": "Service Name",
  "description": "...",
  "allowedEndpoints": ["..."],
  "headers": { "..." },
  "secrets": { "..." },
  "ingestor": {
    "type": "websocket | webhook | poll",
    "websocket": {
      "gatewayUrl": "wss://...",
      "protocol": "discord",
      "eventFilter": ["MESSAGE_CREATE", "MESSAGE_UPDATE"],
      "intents": 3276799,
      "guildIds": ["1234567890"],
      "channelIds": ["9876543210"],
      "userIds": ["1111111111"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Caller-Level Ingestor Overrides

Callers can override any of the template's ingestor settings without modifying the template itself. All fields are optional — omitted fields inherit from the connection template.

```json
{
  "callers": {
    "my-caller": {
      "peerKeyDir": "...",
      "connections": ["discord-bot"],
      "ingestorOverrides": {
        "discord-bot": {
          "intents": 4609,
          "eventFilter": ["MESSAGE_CREATE"],
          "guildIds": ["1234567890"],
          "channelIds": ["9876543210"],
          "userIds": ["1111111111"],
          "bufferSize": 500,
          "disabled": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intents` | `number` | Template value | Override Discord Gateway intents bitmask |
| `eventFilter` | `string[]` | Template value | Override event type filter; empty = all |
| `guildIds` | `string[]` | `[]` (all) | Only buffer events from these guild IDs |
| `channelIds` | `string[]` | `[]` (all) | Only buffer events from these channel IDs |
| `userIds` | `string[]` | `[]` (all) | Only buffer events from these user IDs |
| `bufferSize` | `number` | `200` | Override ring buffer capacity (max 1000) |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disable the ingestor entirely |

**Filtering behavior:**
- Payload filters (`guildIds`, `channelIds`, `userIds`) inspect the event's `d` payload
- Events **without** the filtered field pass through (e.g., `READY` has no `guild_id` — always kept)
- Filters are AND logic: if both `guildIds` and `channelIds` are set, events must match both
- User ID extraction checks `author.id`, `user.id`, and `user_id` (varies by event type)

### Discord Intent Values

| Intent | Value | Privileged |

|---|---|
| `MESSAGE_CREATE` | New messages in channels the bot can see |
| `MESSAGE_UPDATE` | Message edits |
| `MESSAGE_DELETE` | Message deletions |
| `MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD` | Reactions added to messages |
| `MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE` | Reactions removed |
| `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD` | New member joins (requires GUILD_MEMBERS intent) |
| `GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE` | Member leaves/kicked |
| `PRESENCE_UPDATE` | User status changes (requires GUILD_PRESENCES intent) |
