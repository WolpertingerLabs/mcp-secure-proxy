/**
 * Discord Gateway (WebSocket) ingestor.
 *
 * Connects to the Discord Gateway v10 and streams real-time events
 * (messages, reactions, presence updates, etc.) into the ring buffer.
 *
 * Implements the full Gateway lifecycle:
 *   Hello → Identify → Ready → Dispatch loop
 *   Heartbeat with jitter, ACK tracking, zombie detection
 *   Resume support (session_id + sequence)
 *   Exponential backoff reconnection
 *
 * Uses the native WebSocket API (Node 22+).
 *
 * @see https://discord.com/developers/docs/events/gateway
