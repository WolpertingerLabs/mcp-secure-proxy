/**
 * Remote Secure Server — the secrets-holding side.
 *
 * Runs as an HTTP server (localhost or remote). Holds secrets and only
 * communicates through encrypted channels established via mutual auth.
 *
 * This server:
 *   - Authenticates incoming MCP proxy clients via Ed25519 signatures
 *   - Establishes encrypted channels via X25519 ECDH + AES-256-GCM
 *   - Receives encrypted tool requests, injects secrets, executes, encrypts results
 *   - Never exposes secrets in plaintext over the wire
 *   - Maintains an audit log of all operations
 *   - Rate-limits requests per session
